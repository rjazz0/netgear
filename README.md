# Getting Started

Run the unit tests. There will be some tests that fail. You can treat the tests as "the truth" for functionality. In other words, the test file is correct. The non-test files may or may not be.

Please fix as many of the failed tests as possible.

Later on, you'll be asked to code review some of the code.

At the end of the interview, please ZIP up the project folder and send it back to the interviewer. Do not include any non-NETGEAR people on the email.

# Debugging
The first part of the interview is to see how you approach debugging code. Run the unit tests and fix the tests that fail.

Feel free to ask us any questions!

# Code Review
The second part of the interview is to see how you perform code reviews. The review will be both explaining the review to the interviewer as well as adding comments to the code to identifiy the areas for the author to address.

# Tips
- It is okay to use the internet if you need to :)!
- Feel free to ask for help when you need it. The interviewer is there to help.
- Next to the tests that fail, there is a comment with a number. Increasing numeric values indicate the difficulty level (higher numbers are more difficult). If you are having problems, try addressing the lower numbers first.
